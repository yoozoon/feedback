## Data Storage

The system stores data in the `data/` directory:
- `feedback.json` - Contains all feedback submissions
- `statistics.json` - Contains calculated statistics and summaries

### Data Structure

Each feedback entry includes:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-uuid",
  "employeeName": "John Doe",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "motivationLevel": 8,
  "energyLevel": 7,
  "motivationFactors": "Clear goals and supportive team",
  "energyFactors": "Good work-life balance",
  "suggestions": "More team building activities",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "submittedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## API Endpoints

## Customization

### Adding New Departments
Edit the department options in `index.html`:
```html
<option value="Your Department">Your Department</option>
```

### Modifying Form Fields
Add new fields to the form in `index.html` and update the submission handling in both frontend JavaScript and `server.js`.

### Styling Changes
The system uses Tailwind CSS. Modify classes in the HTML files to change the appearance.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Employee names are optional and can be anonymized
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation prevents malicious data
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests
- **File Security**: Data files are stored server-side only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in `server.js`: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;`

2. **Dependencies not installed**
   - Run `npm install` to install required packages

3. **Data not saving**
   - Check that the server has write permissions to the project directory
   - Verify the `data/` directory is created automatically

4. **Dashboard not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the API endpoints are working by visiting them directly

### Development

To modify the system:
1. Edit HTML files for frontend changes
2. Modify `server.js` for backend logic
3. Update `package.json` for new dependencies
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Use environment variables for configuration
2. Set up proper logging
3. Use a process manager like PM2
4. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
5. Set up regular backups of the data directory
6. Configure SSL/HTTPS
